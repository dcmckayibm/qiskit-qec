    "Anisotropic repetition codes are quantum implementations of the repetition code. Standard repetition codes store a logical bit value on a set of qubits (the 'code qubits') by repeating the value to be stored. The two standard versions are the z and x basis encodings, also known as the bit and phase encodings. For the z basis, the bit state `0` corresponds to the state $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes d}$ for $d$ code qubits, and `1` corresponds to $|1\\rangle^{\\otimes d}$. For the x basis encoding, `0` and `1` correspond to $|+\\rangle^{\\otimes d}$ and $|-\\rangle^{\\otimes d}$ respectively. These encodings are sensitive to and protect against bit flip and phase flip noise respectively, but neither is senstive to both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anisotropic repetition codes differ in that they use different bases on different qubits. This means that any run of the code is sensitive to all kinds of error, even though each individual qubit is sensitive only to one. For example, a `basis='zx'` repetition code alternates between the z and x bases. For example, using the code qubit state $|0,+,0,+,\\ldots\\rangle$ to store `0` or $|1,-,1,-,\\ldots\\rangle$ to store `1`.\n",
